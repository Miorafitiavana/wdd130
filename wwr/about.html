            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>What began as a small team of river enthusiasts with a dream soon grew into the heartbeat of white water
                rafting
                adventures. From the early days, Z Splash wasn’t just about tackling rapids—it was about creating
                memories that last a
                lifetime. Our employees brought more than skills; they brought heart, laughter, and a passion for making
                every ride down
                the river unforgettable. Over the years, their dedication has turned Z Splash into the place where
                first-timers become
                lifelong adventurers and where every splash tells a story of fun, teamwork, and thrill. That spirit is
                why Z Splash
                remains the best choice for white water rafting today.
